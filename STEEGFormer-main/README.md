### 1. Methodology
Our framework provides a transparent and rigorous benchmark for EEG foundation models by evaluating them across 6 distinct decoding protocols, ranging from simple population decoding to challenging zero-shot and transfer learning scenarios.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/graphic_overview.png" alt="ST-EEGFormer Architecture and Evaluation Protocols" width="700">
</p>

As a baseline for this benchmark, we introduce ST-EEGFormer: a minimal, ViT-based foundation model. To ensure transparency and ease of reproduction, the model is pre-trained purely through Masked Autoencoder (MAE) reconstruction on raw EEG signals.

### 2. Benchmark Results
Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that while classic neural network decoders remain highly competitive, EEG foundation models often struggle when restricted to linear probing. However, when fully fine-tuned, ST-EEGFormer-large—achieves the best average rank (5.61) among all compared models, despite its large parameter count (>300M).

## 3. Environment

The models are implemented in **PyTorch** and can be used in standard Python environments.

> **Python version used for pre-training:** `3.11.5`

| Category | Package | Version | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Core** | `torch` | 2.4.1 | Deep learning framework |
| **Core** | `timm` | 1.0.10 | Transformer model implementations |
| **Extra** | `wandb` | 0.22.2 | Experiment logging & monitoring |
| **Extra** | `mat73` | 0.65 | Loading MATLAB v7.3 files |
| **Extra** | `scikit-learn` | 1.3.2 | Evaluation metrics and utilities |

### 3.1 Classic EEG Model Dependencies
If you want to run the training code for **classic EEG models**, you will also need:

#### For all downstream tasks except SSVEP
| Package | Version | Note |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `scipy` | 1.16.0 | General scientific computing utilities |
| `numpy` | 1.25.2 | Core numerical computing library |
| `mne` | 1.9.0 | EEG preprocessing and data handling |
| `pyriemann` | 0.6 | Riemannian geometry-based EEG classification |
| `scikit-learn` | 1.4.2 | Machine learning toolkit |
| `lightgbm` | 4.6.0 | Gradient boosting models for tabular features |

## 4. Model Specs

**ST-EEGFormer** is designed for **128 Hz EEG data**.

- Pre-trained to reconstruct **6-second EEG segments**  
- Supports up to **142 EEG channels**  
- Recommended input: **≤ 6-second segments**, sampled at **128 Hz**

The list of available/pretrained channels can be found in:

```text
pretrain/senloc_file
```

## 5. Quick Start

A Jupyter notebook containing a minimal tutorial on how to use the model can be found in:

```text
easy_start/simple_example.ipynb
```

For a complete walkthrough of adding a new downstream dataset to the benchmark pipeline — raw data → preprocessing → `Dataset` class → YAML registration → dispatcher → training — see:

```text
easy_start/bci_iv2a_dataset_tutorial.ipynb
```

The tutorial uses **BCI Competition IV-2A** as the worked example and ends with a sanity-check training cell that reproduces a per-subject decoding run comparing EEGNet, ST-EEGFormer-small, and ST-EEGFormer-large with the production training recipe.

## 6. Reproducibility

If you want to pre-train a model, use the script:

```text
pretrain/ddp_train_eeg.py
```

You will need to prepare your own custom dataset that provides EEG segments and the corresponding channel indices.

If you want to run benchmark experiments on downstream BCI tasks using neural networks, use:

```text
benchmark/neural_networks/wandb_downstream_evaluation.py
```

For dataset preparation and configuration details, please refer to the README file in:

```text
benchmark/neural_networks
```

For an end-to-end worked example using BCI-IV-2A, follow [`easy_start/bci_iv2a_dataset_tutorial.ipynb`](easy_start/bci_iv2a_dataset_tutorial.ipynb).

For the EEG 2025 Foundation Challenge, the code is located in:

```text
eeg_foundation_2025
```

where the models are slightly modified (they include additional channel embeddings for the HBN dataset).
